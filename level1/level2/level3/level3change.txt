As DevOps is intended to be a cross-functional mode of working, those who practice the methodology use different sets of tools—referred to as "toolchains"—rather than a single one.[10] These toolchains are expected to fit into one or more of the following categories, reflective of key aspects of the development and delivery process.

Coding – code development and review, source code management tools, code merging.
Building – continuous integration tools, build status.
Testing – continuous testing tools that provide quick and timely feedback on business risks.
Packaging – artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging.
Releasing – change management, release approvals, release automation.
Configuring – infrastructure configuration and management, infrastructure as code tools.
Monitoring – applications performance monitoring, end-user experience.
